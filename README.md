# Bike-Sales-Dashboard

The dataset is about a bike sales data of an unknown company with pretty self-explanatory fields such as ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age, Purchased Bike. We want to find patterns in bike purchase trends to improve marketing strategies.

Data was sourced from "Alex the Analyst" on YouTube.

## Conclusion
From the dashboard here some things we can infer:
1. Males purchased more bike than females, because male have higher average incomes. 
2. People in the Middle Age group (31-54 years) purchased 4 times more bikes as compared to the Adolescent and Old age groups. 
3. Customers tend to purchase bikes more for shorter commutes (0-1 miles) than longer commutes.
